            <p> 
                I am a 26-year-old database specialist, student, and dog mom. After graduating UC- San Diego, I have been lucky enough to call San Diego my home for 7 years now and even luckier to have found a place in University Heights. Even though I have only lived there for a year, it is one of the best neighborhoods I have ever lived in. Before transplanting to SoCal, I was NorCal bred from Hayward and all around the Bay. When I am not working, I like to switch amongst a multitude of hobbies; from HIIT, open ocean swimming, attempting a new craft – trying acrylic painting right now, playing video games from console to phone, playing tabletop games- such as Magic the Gathering to  Monopoly, reading, or my favorite – trying new restaurants/food places! Oh, and if I may say so I am a crane game wiz! I play at various Round One arcades and my goal is to win in two moves or less. Below is a photo of my last haul. I then sell them. <br>
                As a database specialist, what I do is if something broken with the applications we use; I go in the backend, find out why, then fix it. When I am not doing that, I am helping users with their clinical studies from the creation to closure dealing with calendar input, survey customization, and patient management. <br>
                I honestly fell into the IT sector. After school B.S. in hand I was like well now what? I knew I was not ready for a PhD. I mean one topic for your entire academic career- as you can see from above, I do not even have a narrow field of hobby interest. I had a wide experience in career choice from working in biotech companies to a hostess for Cocos – man the pies. So, I was stuck with the question everyone faces in there like: what do you want to do? And like many who do not have a definitive answer, I turned to UCSD temp to help place me somewhere because -well food and housing is a nice thing to have. However, little did I know this is where I would find my passion and hunger to learn more about computers, but specifically what makes them work. <br>
                So here I am now - excitingly here kicking my new career into over-drive. All thrusters go! I have never been more scared and thrilled in my life. My dad always says, “when one door closes, there is a window open somewhere”. The best part is the skill I will gain in these next 24 weeks are not opening windows and doors but tearing down the walls entirely to this entirely new realm. I can use my skills to advance research and the healthcare world, or dive into the tech world and sharpen my building finesse. <br>

            When I am not studying, you can catch me walking and playing with my corgi baby Cu, hitting the gym, or at the local coffee shops playing Magic the Gathering, gaming, or crafting.
